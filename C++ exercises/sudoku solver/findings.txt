Summarise your findings here (see specification).

mystery2.dat is the only puzzle my function could not solve, so it
must be the unsolvable puzzle

I added an integer variable in the solve_board function to count the
number of times the function is called when solving the puzzle
When solving mystery1.dat, solve_board was called 10985 times but it
was only called 2310 times when solving mystery3.dat.

Therefore,

mystery1.dat must be the extremely hard puzzle and

mystery3.dat must be the hard puzzle

mystery1.dat: extremely hard puzzle
mystery2.dat: unsolvable puzzle
mystery3.dat: hard puzzle
